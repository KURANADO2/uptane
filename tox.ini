# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# Note that this will run coverage twice, adding the data from the second
# run to the first. In the first run, Uptane and TUF will be run in JSON mode,
# and in the second, they will be run in ASN.1/DER mode.
